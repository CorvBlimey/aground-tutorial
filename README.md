About
=====

This repository holds the files for an Aground modding tutorial. The tutorial itself is hosted online, but you might want to clone this to build the documentation locally, or else to get ahold of the tutorial mods.

Build documentation with `make html` run in the docs/ directory (requires sphinx and sphinx-rtd-theme)
