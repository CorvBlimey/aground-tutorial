   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to an unofficial Aground modding tutorial!
==================================================
This guide is written for the Steam version of Aground,
and tested on Linux (Ubuntu) and OSX--I don't have access to Windows right now, but I'll try to
highlight any areas where I expect things will differ.
This "guide" is just an interim solution, as the developers have already announced intent to write their
own, so it's going to be limited mostly to notes I've taken. All that said, I hope you enjoy!
